## Matrix (2D Arrays)

This folder contains Data Structures and Algorithms topics related to 2D arrays (matrices), commonly asked in coding interviews and competitive programming.

Matrix problems emphasize traversal, searching, and optimization using row-wise and column-wise properties.

---

## Topics Covered
- Matrix traversal techniques
- Searching in sorted matrices
- Index mapping between 1D and 2D arrays
- Boundary and edge case handling
- Optimized elimination-based approaches

---

## Key Learnings
- Leveraging matrix properties reduces time complexity.
- Proper boundary checks prevent index-out-of-bounds errors.
- Choosing the correct traversal starting point simplifies logic.
