# FizzBuzz

## 📌 Problem Statement
Given an integer, print:
- **"FizzBuzz"** if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
- **"Fizz"** if the number is divisible by 3
- **"Buzz"** if the number is divisible by 5
- Otherwise, print the number itself

## 🧠 Approach
- Use modulo (`%`) to check divisibility
- Check divisibility by both 3 and 5 first
- Handle remaining cases using conditional statements

## ⏱️ Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## 🛠️ Language Used
- Java
