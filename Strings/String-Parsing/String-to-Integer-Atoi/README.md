# 🔢 Binary Strings – DSA in Java

This folder contains problems related to **binary string manipulation**, where strings consist
only of `'0'` and `'1'`.

These problems combine concepts from:
- String traversal
- Binary arithmetic
- Bit manipulation logic
- Manual simulation of low-level operations

---

## 📌 What Are Binary String Problems?

Binary string problems typically involve:
- Operating on binary representations stored as strings
- Performing arithmetic without converting to integers
- Handling carry propagation manually
- Traversing strings from right to left

They test your understanding of **how computers work at the bit level**.

---

## 🧠 Common Techniques Used

- Two-pointer traversal (right → left)
- Carry handling
- Character-to-integer conversion
- StringBuilder for efficient result construction
- Simulation of binary addition rules

## 🧪 Example Problem

### Add Binary Strings

Given two binary strings, return their sum as a binary string.

**Input**


s1 = "101"
s2 = "11"


**Output**


"1000"
