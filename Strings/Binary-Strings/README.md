# 🔢 Binary Strings – DSA in Java

This folder contains problems related to **binary string manipulation**, where strings consist only of `'0'` and `'1'`.

These problems typically involve:
- Binary arithmetic
- Carry handling
- Bitwise reasoning using string traversal
- Simulation of low-level operations

---

## 📌 Characteristics of Binary String Problems

- Input strings contain only `0` and `1`
- Often involve **manual simulation of binary operations**
- Commonly tagged under **Strings + Bit Manipulation**
- Require careful handling of carry and edge cases

---

## 🧠 Common Techniques Used

- Two-pointer traversal (right to left)
- Carry propagation
- StringBuilder for efficient result construction
- Character-to-integer conversion

---

## 📂 Problems Included

| # | Problem Name | Technique | Time Complexity |
