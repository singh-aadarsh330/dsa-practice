# ➕ String Arithmetic – DSA in Java

This folder contains problems where **mathematical operations are performed directly on strings** without converting them into numeric data types.

These problems simulate arithmetic on large numbers or special formats where native data types are insufficient.

---

## 📌 Characteristics of String Arithmetic Problems

- Numbers are represented as strings
- Direct numeric conversion is either restricted or inefficient
- Requires manual digit-by-digit processing
- Common in problems involving very large numbers

---

## 🧠 Common Techniques Used

- Right-to-left traversal
- Carry handling
- Digit-to-character conversions
- StringBuilder for efficient concatenation

---

## 📂 Problems Included

| # | Problem Name | Operation | Technique |
|---|-------------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Add Binary Strings | Addition | Two Pointers, Carry |

## 🔍 Example Problem Types

- Add Strings (LeetCode 415)
- Multiply Strings
- Add Binary
- Big Integer Operations
