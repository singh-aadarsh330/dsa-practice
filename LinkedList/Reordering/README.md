# Linked List – Reordering

This directory contains linked list problems that focus on **rearranging nodes**
by modifying **pointer connections**, without altering node values.

Problems in this section typically require careful pointer manipulation and
are designed to test understanding of linked list structure and in-place algorithms.

## 📌 What This Section Covers

- Reordering nodes based on position
- Alternating or pattern-based rearrangements
- Group-wise or conditional re-linking
- Structural transformations without extra lists

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Practiced

- Pointer rewiring and safe deletion
- Multi-pointer traversal
- Dummy node technique
- In-place list manipulation (O(1) auxiliary space where possible)

---

## 📂 Problems Included

- Reorder Linked List  
- Remove All Duplicates from Unsorted Linked List  
- Odd–Even Positioned Nodes *(planned)*  
- Swap Nodes in Pairs *(planned)*  

---

## ⏱ Complexity Expectations

Most problems in this section aim for:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) or O(n) depending on constraints

---

## 🎯 Interview Relevance

Reordering problems are frequently asked in:
- Product-based company interviews
- FAANG-style coding rounds
- Competitive programming platforms (GFG / LeetCode)

Mastering this section builds strong confidence in pointer handling and
linked list problem-solving.
