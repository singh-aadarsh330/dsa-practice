# Value Manipulation – Linked List

This section contains linked list problems where the **structure or ordering of nodes is modified**
using pointer manipulation.

Unlike traversal-based problems, these problems focus on **rewiring node connections** to achieve
the desired output.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Reordering nodes
- Swapping nodes
- Position-based rearrangements
- Structural transformations

---

## 🧠 Common Techniques Used
- Pointer rewiring
- Partial list reversal
- Two-pointer merging
- In-place transformations

---

## 📂 Problems Included
- Reorder Linked List
- Odd-Even Linked List
- Swap Nodes in Pairs *(planned)*

---

## ⏱ Complexity Expectations
Most problems in this section aim for:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

## 💡 Interview Relevance
These problems are frequently asked in technical interviews and help build
strong pointer-handling intuition.
