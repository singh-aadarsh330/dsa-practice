# Linked List – Value Manipulation

This directory contains linked list problems that involve **modifying the structure of the list**
through **direct pointer manipulation**, without using extra data structures.

Unlike traversal-based problems, these challenges require a deep understanding of
node relationships and pointer rewiring.

## 📂 What This Section Covers

Problems in this category typically involve:

- Reordering nodes based on position
- Swapping nodes without changing values
- Group-wise or alternating rearrangements
- In-place structural transformations

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Practiced

- Pointer re-linking and detachment
- Partial list reversal
- Multi-pointer coordination
- In-place algorithms (O(1) space)

---

## 📌 Design Philosophy

- **No value modification** — only pointer changes
- **No auxiliary data structures**
- Emphasis on **clean, readable, and interview-safe code**

---

## ⏱ Expected Complexity

Most solutions in this section aim for:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

## 🎯 Interview Relevance

These problems are frequently asked in:
- Product-based company interviews
- FAANG-style coding rounds
- Competitive programming platforms (GFG / LeetCode)

Mastering this section significantly improves confidence in linked list pointer handling.
