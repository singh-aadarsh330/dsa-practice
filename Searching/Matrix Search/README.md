## Matrix Search

This folder contains problems related to **searching patterns in
two-dimensional matrices**.

Matrix search problems focus on efficiently navigating rows and columns
to locate elements or identify special positions such as peaks, while
handling boundary conditions correctly.

---

## Common Techniques
- Brute force traversal
- Binary search on rows or columns
- Binary search using directional guarantees
- Divide and conquer in grids

---

## Key Ideas
- Missing neighbors are often treated as negative infinity
- Sorting is not always required for binary search
- Directional comparisons can guarantee the existence of a solution

---

## Typical Problems
- Find a peak element in a 2D grid
- Search in row-wise and column-wise sorted matrices
- Matrix-based optimization and searching problems

---

## Language
- Java
