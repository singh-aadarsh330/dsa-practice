## Range Search

This folder contains problems related to **searching and counting elements
within a given range**.

Range search problems typically involve answering multiple queries of the form
`[L, R]`, where the goal is to determine how many elements lie inside the range
or whether elements exist within it.

## Common Techniques
- Sorting + linear scan
- Binary search for lower and upper bounds
- Prefix sum / frequency arrays
- Offline query processing

---

## When to Use This Pattern
Range search is useful when:
- Multiple range-based queries are given
- The array does not change frequently
- Efficient querying is more important than modification

---

## Typical Problems
- Count elements in a given range
- Frequency queries
- Range existence checks
- Query-based searching problems

## Language
- Java
