# 🔍 Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm used on **sorted data structures**.  
It works by repeatedly dividing the search space into two halves and comparing the target element with the middle element.

Based on the comparison, one half of the search space is discarded at each step, significantly reducing the number of operations.
